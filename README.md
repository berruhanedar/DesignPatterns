# 🧩 Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of **GoF (Gang of Four) Design Patterns**.  
It is organized into three main categories: **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** patterns.

The purpose of this project is to understand how design patterns solve common software design problems and how they are applied in real-world Java applications.

## 📌 About the Project

Design patterns are proven and reusable solutions to recurring software design problems.  
They help developers write more flexible, maintainable, and scalable code.

This repository includes:

- Practical Java examples of design patterns
- Clear package structure based on pattern categories
- Real-world use cases and explanations
- Clean and understandable implementations

## 🧱 Creational Design Patterns

Creational patterns focus on **object creation**.  
They hide the object creation logic and make the system independent of how objects are created.

### Implemented Patterns

- Singleton
- Builder
- Prototype
- Factory Method

### Key Idea

> “The client asks for an object without knowing how it is created.”

---

## 🏗️ Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns focus on **how classes and objects are composed** to form larger structures.

They answer the question:

- Should we use inheritance (is-a)?
- Or composition (has-a)?

### Implemented Patterns

- Adapter
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Proxy
- Mediator

### Key Idea

> “How are classes and objects organized and connected?”

---

## 🔄 Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on **communication and responsibility distribution** between objects.

### Implemented Patterns

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Iterator
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method

### Key Idea

> “How do objects interact and collaborate?”

## 🧠 Why Design Patterns?

Design patterns help to:

- Reduce code duplication
- Improve maintainability
- Increase flexibility and scalability
- Apply proven best practices
- Write clean and reusable code

---
